// The primary chat interaction logic (creating chat, sending messages) is now
// more tightly coupled with the App.tsx component to manage the `Chat` instance state
// and streaming UI updates. This file might house more specific utility functions
// for Gemini in the future if complex, reusable, non-stateful operations are needed.

// For example, a function to prepare complex 'Part[]' arrays could live here.
// Or, if we had a non-streaming, one-off call that didn't need chat state,
// it could remain.

// console.warn("geminiService.ts is currently less utilized as chat logic is in App.tsx. Consider for future utility functions.");

// Ensure the file still exports something if it's imported elsewhere, or remove imports.
// For this exercise, let's keep it minimal.
